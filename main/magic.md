# MAGIC
Magic makes this project work (unfortunately). If magic fails,
it could be a very long time before you know which magic is
failing. Thus, this page exists to guide you in your wizardrous
journeys.  
Magic is marked at the beginning of classes that use magic.
In general, MAGIC is *specific, arbitrary, string related, programmer inputs that have
no room for error checking or parsing errors*

### Classes
